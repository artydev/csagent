# CSAgent — Cross-Platform Autonomous Coding Agent

**CSAgent** is a cross-platform autonomous coding agent that runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It uses an OpenAI-compatible API (e.g., [Albert API](https://albert.api.etalab.gouv.fr)) to understand natural-language instructions and autonomously perform coding tasks by reading, writing, and listing files, as well as executing shell commands.

It ships with three presentation modes — a terminal UI (TUI), a web UI, and a lean UI.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10.0 SDK or later (for building from source)
- An API key for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g., [Albert API](https://albert.api.etalab.gouv.fr))

### Run with the Web UI

```bash
# Set your API key
set ALBERT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Run the web server
csagent --ui
```

Then open your browser to **http://localhost:5050** (or the port you chose with `--port`).

### Run in CLI Mode

```bash
set ALBERT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
dotnet run
```

---

## Modes of Operation

### CLI Mode (Default)

In CLI mode, CSAgent presents a text-based interactive session. You type instructions, and the agent autonomously works through them step by step.

```
> User: Create a new C# console project that prints "Hello, World!"
```

The agent will:
1. Think about the task
2. Execute tools (write files, run shell commands)
3. Report results
4. Continue until the task is complete

Type `exit` to quit the session.

### Web UI Mode

In Web UI mode (`--ui` flag), CSAgent starts a local web server with a modern, dark-themed interface featuring:

- Real-time streaming of agent thoughts, tool calls, and results via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks (via Prism.js)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- A clean, terminal-inspired aesthetic

The web UI is served at **http://localhost:5050** by default. Use `--port <n>` (or `-p <n>`) to change the port.

### Lean UI Mode

Lean UI mode (`--leanui` flag) is a lightweight duplicate of the Web UI. It serves the same embedded assets and SSE-based chat endpoints, launched via the `--leanui` command-line argument. It is served at **http://localhost:5050** by default (use `--port <n>` to change it).

### Vision / Image Attachments

CSAgent supports **multimodal (vision) prompts** — you can attach an image to a prompt and the agent will analyze it. This works in both the Web UI and the Lean UI, and in the CLI/TUI.

- **Web UI / Lean UI:** click the **📎** (paperclip) button next to the input box to attach an image. A small preview appears; click **✕** to remove it before sending. Supported formats: **PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP** (max **10 MB**).
- **CLI / TUI:** image attachment is handled through the conversation history — once a vision exchange has occurred, the agent automatically keeps using the vision-capable model for the rest of the session.

When an image is attached, CSAgent automatically routes the request to a **vision-capable model** (`gemma-4-31b-it` by default) instead of the standard text model. This routing is automatic and happens in two cases:

1. The current prompt includes an attached image.
2. The conversation history already contains an image from a previous exchange (text-only models reject requests whose history contains image content).

You can override the vision model with the `--model` argument, and the default vision model is defined by `LlmSettings.VisionModel`.

---

## LLM Models

CSAgent uses different LLM models depending on the mode of operation. This is intentional — each model is chosen for its strengths in the specific context.

| Mode | Default Model | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **CLI** | `deepseek-v4-flash` | Fast, lightweight, ideal for interactive terminal sessions where quick turnarounds matter |
| **Web UI** | `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct` | More capable for complex multi-step coding tasks; the Web UI is designed for longer, more involved sessions |
| **Vision (any mode)** | `gemma-4-31b-it` | Used automatically when an image is attached to a prompt (or present in the conversation history); see [Vision / Image Attachments](#vision--image-attachments) |

You can override the default model in any mode using the `--model` argument (see [Command-Line Arguments](#command-line-arguments)).

### Examples

```bash
# CLI mode with a different model
csagent --model gpt-4o

# Web UI mode with a different model
csagent --ui --model deepseek-v4-flash
```

## Future Features

The following capabilities are planned for future releases:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration** — connect to external MCP servers over Streamable HTTP to expose additional tools to the agent.
- **Python scripting** — drive CSAgent from Python scripts: launch sessions, send prompts, and retrieve responses and agent events (steps, tool calls, results) programmatically, for example via a csagent module or a web-interface (SSE) client.

## Safety Features

CSAgent includes multiple layers of safety to prevent accidental damage to your system:

### 1. Destructive Action Confirmation

The `write_file` tool is classified as **destructive** because it modifies files on disk. Before executing, the agent will prompt for confirmation:

```
[?] Allow destructive action 'write_file'? [Y/n]
```

Shell commands (`sh`) are **not** classified as destructive by default, but they are still filtered for dangerous operations (see below).

### 2. Path Restriction

File operations (`write_file`, `read_file`, `list_dir`) are **restricted to the current working directory** and its subdirectories. Attempts to access files outside this scope are blocked:

```
Error: write_file - Path 'C:\Windows\System32\config' is not allowed for writing.
```

### 3. Dangerous Command Filtering

Shell commands are scanned for potentially dangerous patterns before execution. The filter is **platform-aware**:

#### Windows (cmd.exe)
Blocked patterns include:
- `format` — Format drives
- `del /f` / `del /s` — Force/recursive deletion
- `rd /s` / `rmdir /s` — Recursive directory removal
- `reg delete` / `reg add` / `reg import` — Registry manipulation
- `net user` / `net localgroup` / `net share` — System administration
- `takeown` / `icacls` / `cacls` — Permission/ownership changes
- `bcdedit` / `diskpart` — Boot/disk configuration
- `runas` / `powershell start-process -verb runas` — Privilege escalation
- `shutdown` / `reboot` — System control
- `\windows\system32\` / `\windows\system\` — System directory access
- `\program files\` — Protected directory access

#### Unix/Linux/macOS (bash/sh)
Blocked patterns include:
- `sudo` — Privilege escalation
- `chmod` — Permission changes
- `shutdown` / `reboot` — System control
- `dd` — Low-level disk operations
- `mkfs` — File system creation
- `/etc/` / `/usr/bin/` / `/bin/` — System directory access

### 4. Command Timeout

All shell commands have a **60-second timeout**. If a command takes longer, it is automatically killed:

```
Error: command timed out (60s).
```

### 5. File Size Limit

Reading files larger than **500 KB** is blocked to prevent memory issues:

```
Error: file too large (1024 KB). Use sh to grep/head.
```

---

## Available Tools

The agent has access to four built-in tools:

### `write_file`
Write (or overwrite) a text file. Parent directories are created automatically.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (string, required) — File path
- `content` (string, required) — UTF-8 content to write

### `read_file`
Read a text file and return its content.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (string, required) — File path

### `list_dir`
List files and subdirectories in a directory.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (string, optional, default: `.`) — Directory to list
- `recursive` (boolean, optional, default: `false`) — Whether to list recursively

### `sh`
Execute a shell command. Uses `cmd.exe` on Windows, `/bin/sh` elsewhere.

**Parameters:**
- `cmd` (string, required) — Shell command to run

---

## Memory & Conversation Persistence

CSAgent saves the conversation history to a JSON file (default: `agent_memory.json`). This allows the agent to maintain context across sessions.

- The memory file is automatically loaded when the agent starts
- It is saved after each step
- Old messages are trimmed when the total content exceeds ~96 KB to keep context manageable
- You can specify a custom memory file with `--mem <file>` or as a positional argument

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or later

### Build

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Run

```bash
# CLI mode
set ALBERT_API_KEY=your-key
csagent

# Web UI mode
set ALBERT_API_KEY=your-key
csagent --ui
```

---

## AOT Publishing

CSAgent supports **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation** for fast startup and single-file deployment:

```bash
# Publish as a single-file AOT binary
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64   # Windows
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 # Linux
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-x64   # macOS
```

The AOT build produces a self-contained executable with no runtime dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key not set"
Ensure the `ALBERT_API_KEY` environment variable is set before running.

### "API 401: ..."
Your API key is invalid or expired. Check your credentials.

### "API 429: ..."
You've hit the rate limit. CSAgent now retries automatically with exponential
backoff (honoring the server's `Retry-After` header when present). If the error
persists after all retries, the API is still rate-limiting you — wait a moment
and try again. You can tune the retry behavior with `--max-retries` and
`--retry-delay` (see [Command-Line Arguments](#command-line-arguments)).

### "command timed out (60s)"
The shell command took longer than 60 seconds. Try breaking the task into smaller steps.

### "file too large"
The file exceeds the 500 KB read limit. Use `sh` with tools like `grep`, `head`, or `find` to inspect specific parts.

### "Path is not allowed"
File operations are restricted to the current working directory. Change to the target directory before running the agent, or use shell commands to copy files into the workspace.

### Browser doesn't open automatically
Navigate manually to **http://localhost:5050** in your browser (or the port you chose with `--port`).

### "Unsupported image type" / image won't attach
Only **PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP** images are supported, and the file must be **10 MB or smaller**. If you're attaching a different format (e.g. BMP, TIFF, SVG), convert it to a supported format first.

### "Expected multipart/form-data"
This error appears when the `/api/chat` endpoint is called with a `POST` that isn't `multipart/form-data`. The Web UI and Lean UI send the correct content type automatically; this usually only happens with a hand-written client.
